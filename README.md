This project aims at understanding the prediction of FeedForward Neural Network model in detecting network attacks

Label Encoder: for text to numbers, as model can not use text.
One Hot Encoder: it will create n distinct columns in the same dataset to for each distinct entry on the column that we performed Label Encoding earlier. So, each distinct value will have its own column, and the new value in the new column will be set to 1. This is done for each distinct value.
